        <h3>Case Details</h3>
        <p>We want you to carefully review the Figma file we sent you. What is expected from you is to code this design pixel-perfectly, preserving its aesthetic value. What we expect from applicants is to have an approach that goes beyond just creating a user interface and delves into the depths of the design.</p>
        <h3>Other issues we expect from you:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Complete completion of all animations specified in the file.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Making back-end connections (You can find API information in the file we sent you).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Modal Form</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Team</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Must be cross-browser compatible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Must work properly on all desktop resolutions.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical Requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You can develop the project using JavaScript or TypeScript, as preferred. Candidates using TypeScript will be given priority.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We expect you to develop the project with React or Next.js.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We expect you to use libraries such as Axios, React Query, Redux toolkit, etc. in CRUD operations, as needed.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Evaluation Criteria:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Functionality: Does it work in accordance with all requirements?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Code Quality: Is it clean, organized and readable code?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Responsive (desktop only): Does it adapt to different screen sizes (13 inches - 27 inches)?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Pixel Perfect: Does it provide an aesthetic that fits our design vision?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Points:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Mobile resolution is not mandatory since we do not submit the design. Candidates who do will receive additional points.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You can add animation to the design according to your own aesthetic understanding. For example: Parallax, text animations, smooth scrolling.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
